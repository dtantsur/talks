Writing Asynchronous SNMP Agents

Despite the raise of many alternative network management
technologies, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
is still widely used and universally supported.

In this presentation the technology behind SNMP will be explained,
followed by the deep dive into the typical work flow of building
an asynchronous SNMP agent in pure Python starting from a MIB file
up to the fully-functional Python application.

Pythonistas and DevOps folks who are looking into network management
automation will hopefully find this talk inspiring and relevant.
